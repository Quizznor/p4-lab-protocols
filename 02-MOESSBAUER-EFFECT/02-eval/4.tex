\subsection{Vacromium}
\label{ssec:vacromium}

Next, a vacromium absorber is placed in the beam path\footnote{The vacromium
Mössbauer spectrum was measured last during the lab exercise. To streamline the text
it is however decided to discuss the material already here.}. The analysis of data
proceeds as is presented in \autoref{ssec:iron}. One absorption peak can be
discovered in the vacromium Mössbauer spectrum as seen in \autoref{fig:vacromium} and
\autoref{tab:vacromium}.

The FWHM for Ch1 and Ch2 in terms of photon energy caused by the Doppler shift is 

\begin{align*}
\Gamma_\text{Ch1} &= \SI{5.250\pm1.009e-9}{\electronvolt} \\
\Gamma_\text{Ch2} &= \SI{5.041\pm1.644e-9}{\electronvolt}.
\end{align*}

It follows a mean value of $\Gamma = \SI{5.146\pm0.965e-9}{\electronvolt}$. From
this the mean lifetime $\tau$ of the metastable \SI{14.4}{\kilo\electronvolt} 
$^{57}$Fe-state is given by the time-energy uncertainty relation.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:tau-iron}
\tau\cdot\Gamma = \hbar \Leftrightarrow \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} = \SI{127.91\pm23.98}{\nano\second}
\end{equation}

This lies within the expectation of a literature value $\tau=\SI{141}{\nano\second}$ 
extracted from \cite{nishida1981moessbauer}.
