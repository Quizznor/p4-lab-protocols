\subsection{Vacromium}
\label{ssec:vacromium}

Next, a vacromium absorber is placed in the beam path\footnote{The vacromium
Mössbauer spectrum was measured last during the lab exercise. To streamline the text
it is however decided to discuss the material already here.}. The analysis of data
proceeds as is presented in \autoref{ssec:iron}. One absorption peak can be
discovered in the vacromium Mössbauer spectrum as seen in \autoref{fig:vacromium} and
\autoref{tab:vacromium}.
