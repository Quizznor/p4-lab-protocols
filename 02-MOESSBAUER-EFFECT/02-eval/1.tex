\section{Setup}
\label{sec:setup}

The experiment consists of several components. A schematic setup can be seen in 
\todo\autoref{fig:setup}. An interferometer monitors the velocity at which the MÃ¶ssbauer 
driving unit (MVT) as well as $\gamma$-source are moving relative to the lab frame.
A target can be placed in the beam path of the high-energy photons. The transmitted
number of photons is then counted by a 512 channel multi-channel-scaler (MCS). The 
various other components of the setup (MDU, DFG, etc.) are used for calibration as 
well as data acquisition (DAQ) purposes, more detailed information on the individual
building blocks can be taken from \cite{Sch17}.
