\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Several qualities of different electrical conductors have been tested both 
qualitatively and quantitatively. While the measurement results overall conform to
the theory established in \autoref{chap:theory}, large discrepancies are found when 
comparing the exact numerical results of e.g. the Curie-temperature of Copper to 
literature values. Even cross checks between results in this report fail. The mean
free path of niobium for example has been calculated in two different ways. The two
results differ by a two orders of magnitude. This hints at systematic errors in the 
analysis. Espically the calibration temperature to the different thermometers is 
thought to be faulty.
