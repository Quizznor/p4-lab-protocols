\caption{Raw number of events counted in every channel for each measured angle.
  The dashed black lines indicate the theoretical energy a photon has after
  undergoing compton scattering at an angle $\theta$. The distance between signal
  peaks and this energy grows with increasing scattering angles. This is expected
  due to the imperfect calibration.}\label{fig:diff-measurements2}
