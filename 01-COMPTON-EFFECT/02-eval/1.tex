\section{Experimental setup}
\label{sec:setup}

The multi channel analyser (MCA) consists of a $\SI{20.43}{\centi\meter\squared}$
large NaJ scintilling crystal as well as a photo-multiplier (PMT) useful for
signal amplification. A readout chip allows for the digital treatmeant of measurement
data. The detector is placed on metallic guiding rails that allow the scintillator
to be placed at various positions on a circle around a plastic pedestal. A small
$\SI{1}{\centi\meter}\times\SI{1}{\centi\meter}$ target can be placed on the
pedestal such that it is located in the beam path of a high-energy $\gamma$-source.
The angle enclosed by the beam path and a line connecting scintillator detector with
the target pedestal defines the scattering angle $\theta$.
