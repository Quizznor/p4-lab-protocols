\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Different aspects of Compton scattering were tested both qualitatively and
quantitatively. While the results of the presented analysis are generally in good
accordance with theoretical models of the process, several predictions, such as
the rest mass of the electron, made by the model fail. One of the key things that
can be improved in this report is the quality of the MCA calibration to measured
energy. Allowing for more calibration points greatly improves the quality of the
resulting fit.
