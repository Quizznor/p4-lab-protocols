\section{Energy shift \& electron rest mass}
\label{sec:energy-shift}

In an attempt to estimate the rest mass of the electron, \autoref{eq:photon-energy}
can be manipulated.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:linear-regression}
\frac{1}{E_{\gamma,f}} = \frac{1}{E_{\gamma,i}} + \frac{1}{m_e}\cdot\left(1-\cos\theta\right).
\end{equation}

The photon energy $E_{\gamma,f}$ post-scattering can be directly extracted from the
location of the gaussian peaks present in the measured compton spectra. For the sake
of a more solid analysis, a normal distribution is fitted to each peak. The results
of these processes are listed in \autoref{tab:energy-shift}. The mean of the best fit
is then taken as $E_{\gamma,f}$ in the subsequent discussion.

\input{./tab/energy-shift}

It has to be mentioned that the linear regression used to gather information about
$m_e$ only has one free parameter, the electron mass itself. The inverse initial
photon energy is manually set to \SI{1/661.659}{\per\kilo\electronvolt} and assumed
to be free of any errors. This is necessary to ensure a stable (and reasonably
sensible) fit result. The analysis finds the best fit parameter

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:electron-mass-estimate}
	m_e = \SI{459.72 \pm 6}{\kilo\electronvolt},
\end{equation}

which deviates from the literature value (\SI{510.999}{\kilo\electronvolt}
\cite{patrignani2016review}) by about 10\%. It does not lay within the uncertainty
bounds of the "correct" value. Possible reasons are an underestimation of systematic
errors in the energy calibration. Correlations between the respective measurements
are also expected to play a part. The results of this analysis are visualised in
\autoref{fig:energy-shift}

	angles. This again hints at a poor energy calibration of the MCA.}
