\section{Compton scattering}
\label{sec:compton-scattering}

Consider the scenario of a high-energy photon interacting with an unbound electron as
shown in \autoref{fig:compton-scattering}. To describe this process we choose a
coordinate frame where the electron is at rest with respect to us. In the experiments
to be presented in this report such a coordinate frame conveniently is the lab frame
anyways. \\
From the conservation of energy and impluse we can construct a theoretical
description of this process based on the inital and final energies of both particles.

\begin{align*}
E_{\gamma,i} + \underbrace{E_{e,i}}_{=0}\,&=\,E_{\gamma,f}+E_{e,f} \\
p_{\gamma,i} + \underbrace{p_{e,i}}_{=0}\,&=\,p_{\gamma,f}+p_{e,f}
\end{align*}

From the above relations an expression for the energy of the photon after interacting
with the electron can be obtained and reads

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:photon-energy}
E_{\gamma,f}=\frac{E_{\gamma,i}}{1+\frac{E_{\gamma,i}}{m_e c^2}(1-\cos\theta)},
\end{equation}

where $\theta$ defines the angle spanned between the incident photon and its path
post scattering. It follows that the electron gains energy from the interaction.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:electron-energy}
E_{e,f}=E_{\gamma,i}-E_{\gamma,f}=E_{\gamma,f}\cdot\frac{E_{\gamma,i}}{m_e c^2}\cdot(1-\cos\theta).
\end{equation}

The measureable change in the photons wavelength $\lambda=\frac{hc}{E_{\gamma}}$
due to the interaction is called the \textbf{Compton effect}. The underlaying elastic
scattering of photons and unbound electrons is consequently labelled \textbf{Compton
scattering}.
