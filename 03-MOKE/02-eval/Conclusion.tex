\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This experiment is intended to test various properties of different magnetic materials,
as well as introduce the magneto-optic Kerr-effect as an effective measurement tool.
Unfortunately not all aspects of the properties mentioned in this lab report could be
tested experimentally. This is in part caused by the poor quality of samples and
outdated measurement software. The physical phenomena that were observed during the
lab exercise largely conform to theoretical expectations.
